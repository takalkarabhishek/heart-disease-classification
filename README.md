# Heart Disease Classification
### Predicting whether a person has Heart Disease or not using Machine Learning
### We are going to cover the following approach
### 1. Problem Definition
### 2. Data
### 3. Evaluation
### 4. Features
### 5. Modelling

## 1. Problem Definition
In a nutshell

Given Clinical parameters of the patient can we predict whether a person has Heart Disease or not?

## 2. Data
### Source (taken from UCI) : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

1. age
2. sex
3. cp
4. trestbps
5. chol
6. fbs
7. restecg
8. thalach
9. exang
10. oldpeak
11. slope
12. ca
13. thal
14. target (the predicted attribute)

## 3. Evaluation :
What defines Success?

If we achieve 95% accuracy in predicting whether a person has Heart Disease or not, only then will the project be persuaded

## 4. FeaturesÂ¶
Details about the Data
Data Dictionary :
age: age in years
sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp: chest pain type
Value 1: typical angina
Value 2: atypical angina
Value 3: non-anginal pain
Value 4: asymptomatic
trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
Value 0: normal
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Value 1: upsloping
Value 2: flat
Value 3: downsloping
ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
target: 0-Not Heart Disease, 1-Heart Disease
